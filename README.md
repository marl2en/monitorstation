# monitorstation
A Raspberry Pi powered by a solar panel

The main software is located in monitor3.py
It may look complicated, but everything is straight forward:
Read config file.
Set up log file. 
Load battery files (voltage, capacity, energy) as numpy arrays. 
Start a monitor thread (runs in background) to monitor every minute (or other interval) all values that should be measured or logged. 
Save values in a csv-file (comma seperated file) for further analysis. 
AnalyzeData and AnalyzeLastDays are functions to calculate and estimate power consumption and production.  

- Create a directory /home/pi/MonitorStation
- Copy monitor3.py, monitor.sh, all numpy files (.npy) and config.json to it. 
- Edit config.json: your telegram token and chat_id (from your telegram app in your mobile), battery is a lead battery (12V, 12Ah), adjust battery factor, standby current to your system. 
- WittyPi is needed because: operation 24/7 is not possible under winter time. Only one hour per day works here (Sweden). 
- WittyPi extracts needed values (battery voltage, output voltage to RPi and current)
- in the wittypi folder (after installation of wittypi) edit asterStartup.sh and insert: 
/home/pi/wittypi/syncTime.sh 
/home/pi/MonitorStation/monitor.sh
- place WittyPi.py (a python library for wittypi) into wittypi folder. Look here: https://github.com/marl2en/wittypi4python
